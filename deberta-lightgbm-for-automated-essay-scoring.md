Project Overview:
Automated Essay Scoring with Open-Source Solutions Background The first automated essay scoring competition, the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP), was held twelve years ago. Since then, advancements in Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) systems have aimed to reduce the time and cost associated with manual grading of student essays. However, many of these advancements are not widely accessible due to cost barriers, limiting their impact, especially in underserved communities.

Goal The goal of this competition
is to develop an open-source essay scoring algorithm that improves upon the original ASAP competition. By leveraging updated datasets and new ideas, the aim is to provide reliable and accessible automated grading solutions to overtaxed teachers, particularly in underserved communities. The competition seeks to reduce the high expense and time required for manual grading and enable the introduction of essays into testing, a key indicator of student learning.

Dataset
The competition utilizes the largest open-access writing dataset aligned with current standards for student-appropriate assessments. The dataset includes high-quality, realistic classroom writing samples, addressing the limitations of previous efforts by encompassing diverse economic and location populations to mitigate potential algorithmic bias. The dataset focuses on common essay formats used in classroom settings, providing a more expansive and representative sample for training and evaluation. Approach

Data Loading,
We begin by importing the necessary libraries for our task, including pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, numpy, and torch. Data Loading We load the training data from a CSV file using pandas read_csv function. The df_train DataFrame now holds our training data
